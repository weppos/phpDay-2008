== Passwords

First of all create a file called keys.private and define the following constants in order to use the scripts included in this package.

    <?php
    
    define('AKISMET_API_KEY', '');
    
    define('DELICIOUS_USERNAME', '');
    define('DELICIOUS_PASSWORD', '');
    
    define('TECHNORATI_API_KEY', '');
    
== Zend Framework Library

All scripts in this package require a valid Zend Framework (1.5) distribution.
If you don't have one, download the latest from http://framework.zend.com/ and decompress the archive into your local hard disk. Then, change the constant CHANGEME_ZFPATH to point to your zend framework local folder.
    
== Command line scripts

All files ending with .cli.php are intended to be run from command line.
All other scripts can be run both from a command line or a web browser.
